- Claude seemingly does not want to use the angular cli to create components and things - likely need to update claude md to say so
- Claude also only sometimes wants to create services in their own folder - probably want an md within that folder
- Potentially need to add some sort of current work context file, even if it is only temporary - or maybe some feature level context files that summarizes how they work
- on bugs - if you know something about the bug, tell claude
