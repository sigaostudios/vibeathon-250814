Sigao Vibeathon 2024 --- **Team Mascot Challenge**
================================================

**Project Brief**

* * * * *

Overview
--------

You and your team will **design, build, and deploy an original, interactive digital mascot**---a browser-based character with real personality and a live connection to something in the outside world. The mascot should be more than an animation: it must react, display emotion, respond to external events or data, and be fun to interact with.\
**At least 80% of all code must be AI-generated and guided by your team.** (You can use tools like ChatGPT, Claude Code, Opencode, Copilot, etc.)\
All work will be checked in to your team's branch on <https://github.com/sigaostudios/vibeathon-250814>.

Core Requirements
-----------------

### 1\. **AI-Created and Guided**

-   At least **80% of all project code** (JS/TS, assets, logic, config) must be written/generated by an AI tool, with your team acting as guide/editor.

-   You may use **Angular, Phaser, or any other frontend/browser-based tech** you want.

-   **All prompts, AI conversations, and code generation steps must be documented** in your repo's README or in a `/prompts` folder for auditability.

### 2\. **Mascot Personality**

-   Your mascot must have a **defined personality**:

    -   Give it a name, traits, and a unique backstory or attitude.

    -   It should display **different emotions or moods** in response to outside world events or user actions.

    -   It must have at least 3 distinct emotional states/expressions.

### 3\. **Connects to the Outside World**

-   The mascot must be **driven by a real external data source**.\
    Example sources:

    -   Codebase metrics (pull requests, issues, deploys, commit messages)

    -   Weather API or real-time news

    -   Team Slack/Discord/Teams channel events

    -   Any other live, observable data (your team's choice)

-   You are encouraged to **be creative** with this connection---think of fun or unexpected ways for the mascot to reflect real world activity!

### 4\. **Interactivity**

-   Users must be able to **interact** with the mascot through the browser (click, type, drag, play minigame, etc.).

-   Interactions must result in **visible changes** in the mascot's behavior, mood, or environment.

-   The experience must feel "alive," not static.

### 5\. **Browser-Based and Deployable**

-   Must be **100% browser-based**---works on Chrome/Edge/Firefox with no backend required beyond API calls or webhook listeners.

-   Must be **deployable and viewable** by the judges and all Sigao team members via a public URL.

-   All source code and assets must be checked into your team's branch on the Vibeathon repo.

### 6\. **Test Harness / Demo Mode**

-   You must provide a **test harness or demo panel** that lets judges simulate all mascot moods and external data signals---no waiting for "real" events to occur.

-   The harness must be accessible in the deployed app and allow full demonstration of the mascot's reactions and features.

### 7\. **Documentation**

-   Include a clear **README**:

    -   How to run and deploy

    -   How to use the test harness

    -   What AI tools/prompts were used

    -   What external data source(s) you connected

    -   Mapping between triggers and mascot behavior
